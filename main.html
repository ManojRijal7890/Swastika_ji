    <p>I love how you share your favorite songs in the videos or photos you upload—it’s like getting into the world of your music.

        I think I started liking you, should I say Like or I’m falling in loveeeee.  And it feels both exciting and confusing at theee same timeeee. Every time we talk or spend time together I feel a little nervous and happyyyyyy at the same moment It's a feeling that I’ve ben trying to understand and  I can’t deny the fact that I really like you. But at the same time I’m not sure if it’s the right timeee or if you feel the same way about me. That uncertainty makes it harder to share how I feelll. The connection we have is really important to meeee and I don't wanna risk the bond we got. If I told you how I feel I’m sacred that it might change the things between us sometimessss it easier to keep these feeling  it to myself rather than takie the chances of things becoming awkward. If someday this thing came up for sure I’m gonna tell youuuuu. But at the same time hiding it doesn’t feel great either. The truth is I don’t know what will happen if I tell you. Part of me wants to be honest but another part is afraid of the outcomeeeee. It’s hard to know if I should take that step or it’s better to wait and see what happens. I don’t want to lose the bond we shareeee because it means alotttttt to meeeeee So for now I will keep alll my feelings to myselffff and enjoy the time we have together. Maybe one day I’ll find the right time to tell you or maybe things will unfold naturally . I hope by that time it won’t be that lateee
