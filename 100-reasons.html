  <h1>100 Reasons Why I Like You</h1>
  <p class="intro">
   
    I’ve realized that talking to you every day has become the best part of my day. The more I get to know you, the more I admire everything about you. I wrote down 100 reasons why I like you… and honestly, I could keep going.
    Hehe, the funny thing is I wrote this back in August. Things may not be the same now, and we don’t talk like we used to. I kept it just the way it was — because it was true then, and it’s still true in its own way.
